The code is strutured into three libraries:
(1) Python_Avalanche_Module
(2) Python_Avalanche_PreProcessing
(3) seNorge_Model_Python

(1) contains the scripts for training statistical models on the data which are prepared using (2) and (3).
The latter is a Python version of the seNorge model adapted from the original R scripts published at
